        <h2><i class="fa fa-yelp" style="font-size:48px;color:red"></i> Las Vegas Restaurants</h2>
        <h3>There may be a large market for food trucks in Las Vegas</h3>
        <p>Buisness Owners in Las Vegas have catered to the demand of vacationers/tourists, 
            as Las Vegas has had a reputation built upon its quality bars, fine dining restaurants, buffets, and desserts. Fast food is also very common
            within las vegas because the marketing teams of these food chains have stategically placed chains within high foot traffic/population. 
            Though we see a small amount of food truck restaurants, consumers have enjoyed food trucks the most out of all other categories within Las Vegas.

        <p> Though there exists a small amount of food trucks within Las Vegas as shown in the pie chart,
            we see that the consumers who have went to these food trucks have enjoyed their experience a lot. We see this through 
            the pictogram where it shows that 81% of users rated food trucks with a yelp review rating of four or five. Though market is small 
            for food trucks, an enjoyable experience seems to appear fairly frequently.

        </figure>
        <p>Vizualized above, we observe the count of each rating across all Food Trucks in Las Vegas, if you were to add any other category in the column chart
            we can clearly see the size of five star ratings being a lot greater than the size of all other ratings. 
            When comparing with other categories using the buttons above the chart, we do see all the other categories have a much higher <b>count</b> 
            of total ratings, but we also see all other categories have a lower <b>percentage</b> of five star ratings 
            (use toggle percent button to see this). This shows that though there are more ratings given for other categories, indicating a lot more customers,
            but consumers have enjoyed food trucks a higher percentage of times than any other categories. This shows there is a bit of an untapped market 
            for food trucks in Las Vegas. Since there is a lot of tourist foot traffic there could be a large market.
